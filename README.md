# 🐍 Snake Game in Python  

A simple terminal-based Snake game built with Python using the `curses` library. Controls: Arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →).  

*Why this project?*  
After a break from Python, I revisited it by building this nostalgic game to brush up on:  
- Keyboard input handling  
- Terminal rendering (`curses`)  
- Game state logic  

*(Bonus: No dependencies beyond Python’s standard library!)*  

## How to Run  
```bash
python snake_game.py
